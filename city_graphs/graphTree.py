class GraphTree:
    """
    This class represents trees used with graphs.
    These trees hold spanning trees created via a graph traversal.
    
    Both depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search
    (BFS) graph traversals produce spanning trees.
    
    There are algorithms for finding minimum spanning trees (MSTs)
    of a graph and the shortest path between vertices in a graph.  
    These spanning trees and paths are stored in GraphTrees.
    
    Each node in the tree is a vertex from the graph.
    There are four instance variables for this GraphTree.
    1. The root of the tree: root 
    2. The list of vertices in the graph: vertices
    3. The vertices are stored in a Python list called 
       search_order as they are visited by the traversal.  
    4. The parent vertices for the vertices in the traversal are 
       also stored in a Python list called parents.
